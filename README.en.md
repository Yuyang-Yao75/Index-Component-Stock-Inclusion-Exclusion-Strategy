## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This repository focuses on **forecasting index constituent changes** and **backtesting adjustment strategies**. It is designed to help researchers and investors understand the quantitative implementation of index methodology and evaluate the impact of constituent changes on portfolio performance. Core capabilities include:

* Forecasting CSI 300 index constituent changes based on the official index methodology.
* Strategy construction inspired by Guoyuan Securities' report *"Harley Covenant: Stock Selection Strategy Based on Index Adjustment"*, including backtesting, parameter optimization, and weight allocation.
* Providing transparent data processing pipelines and backtest outputs.

## âœ¨ Features

### 1) **Automated Data Retrieval & Caching**

* Wrapper around **iFinDPy** APIs for batch retrieval of **CSI 300** and **A-share universe** data.
* Automatic handling of missing values and consistency checks.
* Results cached into **Excel** to reduce redundant API calls and accelerate iteration.

### 2) **Rigorous Universe Construction & Screening**

* Sample construction aligned with index methodology:

  * Exclusion of \**ST/*ST** stocks.
  * Filters on **listing age** and **suspension days**.
  * Scoring by **market cap** and **turnover**.
  * Liquidity screen (50%â€“60% percentile) to retain tradable names.

### 3) **CSI 300 Buffer & Inclusion Logic**

* Reproduction of CSI rules with separation of **incumbents vs. candidates**.
* Implements **240/360 rank buffer zones** with **priority add/remove** labels.
* Dynamically maintains exactly **300 constituents**, faithfully simulating index add/drop events.

### 4) **Forecast Evaluation & Export**

* Auto-compare forecasts with **official add/drop lists**.
* Compute **hit rate** and produce **difference reports** with explanations.
* Export results to **Excel**, supporting batch replays and accuracy analysis.

### 5) **Event-Driven Backtest Engine**

* Configurable **announcement-day (N)** / **effective-day (M)** offsets.
* Portfolio construction modes: **equal-weight**, **total market-cap**, **free-float market-cap**.
* Daily NAV tracking with performance metrics: **return, max drawdown, Sharpe, Calmar**, etc.

### 6) **Parameter Optimization & Visualization**

* Built-in **grid search** for timing and weighting hyperparameters.
* Generates **heatmaps, box plots, sensitivity curves** for robust configuration selection.

### 7) **One-Click Weight Scheme Generator**

* Standalone script to compute target weights under **equal-weight**, **total cap**, and **free-float cap**.
* Exports **trade guidance** with suggested **lot sizes**, ready for live or simulated execution.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Prepare Data**: Ensure all Excel/CSV files are placed in the correct directories. Some historical constituent data may need manual download from iFinD.
2. **Run Forecast Script**:

   ```bash
   python Index Constituents Forecast/CSI300_constituent_forecast.py
   ```

   Enter the target year and month when prompted. The script outputs processed data and forecast results.
3. **Run Backtest Script**:

   ```bash
   python Strategy Backtest/strategy_backtest.py
   ```

   Configure index code, backtest period, M/N offsets, and weight schemes in the script. Comment/uncomment features as needed.
